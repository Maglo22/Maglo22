### Hi, I'm Br1
#### (_Bruno_, because '1' in spanish is 'uno')

I'm a software engineer from Mexico. I recently graduated, yet I feel like I barely know anything to consider myself an engineer.

Most of my experience is in building web based applications. I've made _things_ using different frameworks like Laravel, Django or Express. I'd say I'm more of a back-end than a front-end person, but I enjoy doing both.

Even though I've spent most of my time in languages for the web like PHP, Python, HTML, JavaScript, I enjoy writting things in C; not sure if it is because of the language's simplicity or something else.

I realy like videogames. I studied Computer Science because I wanted to know how to make one. Still haven't got the courage to do it.

Besides software related things, I also do some casual photography, which you can check out, if you want, on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/br1.mg/). I practice both regular and _virtual_ photography, which is why I have another [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/br1.vp/) for that second kind of photos.
