### Hi, I'm Br1
#### (_Bruno_, because '1' in spanish is 'uno')

I'm a software engineer from Mexico. I recently graduated, yet I feel I know nothing about software; maybe someday I'll stop feeling that way.

Most of my experience is in building web based applications. I've made _things_ using different frameworks like Laravel, Django or Express. I'd say I'm more of a back-end than a front-end person, although since the front-end is what the user sees and interacts with, it is much more important in most cases.

Even though I've spent most of my time in languages for the web like PHP, Python, HTML, JavaScript, I enjoy writting things in C; not sure if it is because of the language's simplicity or something else.

I realy like videogames. I studiend Computer Science because I wanted to know how to make one, and do it. I'm currently learning how to use Unreal so maybe I can create the next big thing: **Pong 2**.

Besides software related things, I also do some casual photography, which you can check out, if you want, on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/br1.mg/). And like I said in the paragraph above, I really like videogames, and I also enjoy taking pictures inside them, or virtual photography if you will. I have another [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/br1.vp/) for that kind of photos.
