### Hi, I'm Br1
#### (_Bruno_, because '1' in spanish is 'uno')

I'm a software engineer from Mexico.

Most of my experience is in building web based applications. I've made _things_ using different frameworks like Laravel, Django, Angular. I enjoy doing both front-end and back-end implementations; I can say I have been doing more front-end than back-end stuff.

Even though I've spent most of my time in languages for the web like PHP, Python, HTML, JavaScript, I enjoy writting things in C.

I enjoy playing videogames. I studied Computer Science because I wanted to know how to make one. Still haven't got the courage to do it.

Besides software related things, I also do some photography and videography, which you can check out, if you want, on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/br1.mg/) and in this [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@temporallobe?si=cWI-j4aM5HCD_6zD). I practice both regular and _virtual_ photography, which is why I have another [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/br1.vp/).
